# Interactive Visual Reinforcement Learning on Atari's Breakout
#### A CS-8395 Project (WIP)

This project intends to address challenges with understanding complex reinforcement learning agents on complicated tasks like Atari games through visual aids.  


Code adapted from Sam Greydanus' work:

https://github.com/greydanus/visualize_atari - generate saliency maps of agent playthroughs
https://github.com/greydanus/baby-a3c - for a3c model training
